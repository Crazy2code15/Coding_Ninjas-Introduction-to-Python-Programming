    "Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "Palindrome\n",
    "A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which read the same backwards and forwards.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If the input string happens to be, \"malayalam\" then as we see that this word can be read the same as forward and backwards, it is said to be a valid palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output for this example will print, 'true'.\n",
    "From that being said, you are required to return a boolean value from the function that has been asked to implement.\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.\n",
    "Output Format:\n",
    "The only line of output prints either 'true' or 'false'.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of.\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "0 <= N <= 10^6\n",
    "Where N is the length of the input string.\n",
